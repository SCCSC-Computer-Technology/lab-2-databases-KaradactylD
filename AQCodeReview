the program visually looks amazng the interface is very aestetically pleasing and the addition of movies that were filmed in those sates is very cool. unfortunatley I couldnt get the program to run properly 
only because it didnt seem to like how the picture box was loading an image. the other code however looks correct the only thing i couldnt find were the sorting queries (i.e. by state, pop aescinding, pop descending, etc). 
The value returning queries however look great.
